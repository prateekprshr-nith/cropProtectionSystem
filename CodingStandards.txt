You must strictly adhere to following coding conventions 
while writing your code:

1) PascalCasing:	ClassNames
   
   The names of ant class that you are implementating should
   be PascalCased.
   e.g. : 	class SampleClass:
   				...
   				...Rest of code
   				...
   
   				
2) camelCasing:		functionNames, variableNames
   
   The names of the variables and the functions that you are
   declaring/using should be camelCased.
   e.g. :	def fooFunc(img):
   				colorImage = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.BGR2GRAY)
   				return colorImage
   				
3) Usage of parenthesis:	in arithematical expressions
   
   Please use parenthesis explictly to avoid any ambiguity in
   your expression. Always put a space between the operand and
   the operator.
   
   e.g. :	wrong way -> a = 2 % 3 * 4
   			right way -> a = (2 % 3) * 4
   			
4) Assignment statements:

   Always put a tab or preferably four spaces between an identifier
   and an assignment operation.
   e.g. :	wrong way -> colorImage = ...
   						 grayImg = ...
   						 
   			right way -> colorImage	= ...
   						 grayImg	= ...
   						 
5) Documentation and comments:

   Always comment the code which, you think, won't be easy to grasp
   by some other person. Put the comment before the beginning of a
   block like:
   
   		# Convert the image from color to gray
   		grayImg	= cv2.cvtColor(colorImg, cv2.BGR2GRAY)
   		...
   		...Rest of the code
   		...
   
   For the modules and the functions, always use the triple quoted
   comments before writing any code, so that pyDoc can parse those
   comments and show up as a help message.
   
   e.g.:	=> Before statring a module
   
   			"""
   			detect.py - The module containing functions
			for the detection of animals.
			Author - Prateek Prasher, CSED NITH
			"""
			
			=> In a function
			def isMotion():
				"""
				This function is used to find any motion
				in the video feed. The function accepts
				2 images as arguments and return a bool
				value
				"""
				...
				...Rest of the code
				...
			   			    
6) Last but not the least:
	HAVE FUN :D
